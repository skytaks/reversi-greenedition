Hello!

I have made a custom site skin, its my take on the reversi skin but with a green aesthetic to it, its meant to be a dark mode skin

The code can be found [here](https://github.com/skytaks/reversi-greenedition/blob/main/reversi-greenedition)

INSTALLATION:

1. Go to skin/create new skin or click here to go directly to the page
2. Click on "use wizard", go to the colors section and in the following fields, complete them like this: 
    <ul>  • Background color: #081C15</ul>
    <ul>   • Text color: #EFFAF1</ul>
     <ul>  • Header color: #081C15</ul>
      <ul> • Accent color: #081C15</ul>
3. Go back to "write custom css" and on "type" select <strong>site skin</strong>
4. On the title, put whatever you want, but remember it has to be unique (mine was reversi green edition - [my username])
5. Go to the "advanced/media" section and select <strong>screen</strong>
6. Go to the CSS section, and paste the code
7. Go to submit and you're done!
